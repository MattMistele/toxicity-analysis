{"cid": "UgxV7Zh1BBuRiw88c1J4AaABAg", "text": "Forcing Harvard to only consider objective, numerical criteria for admissions is only fair under the assumption of equal starting conditions for the applicants. But what Harvard is mainly trying to measure is potential, and for that measure you have to consider starting conditions, not absolute scores on tests which can be boosted by means which do not reflect increased potential. Once you consider starting conditions of the applicants, it's a pretty trivial inference that many of the African American applicants who are edged out in test scores actually have more potential than many White or Asian students whose parents have propped them up. This lawsuit is trying to prevent Harvard from considering potential, which is inherently subjective, in deciding who gets the opportunity to develop their potential at Harvard. The premises of the lawsuit are in direct contradiction therefore with the mission of Harvard or most any university.﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Will Moffett"}

Can you fathom how specific that is??? If you were paying attention the video did not even confirm that race was one of the 200, it never said it once.The statements you saw were from literally two different interviewers interviewing two different applicants and yet they still got the similar vibes of academically exceptionally people who still were not memorable...maybe if you were honest with yourself you would see that maybe that says something? Maybe if multiple different people are interviewing thousands of Asians and who are exceptionally smart yet still don't seem like memorable or outstanding otherwise, maybe there is something too it? This is Harvard we are talking about, everyone there is capable of getting straight As. They want people who provide more than that, who are well rounded, rule breakers, ground shakers, innovators, people who inspire them, who think outside of the box , who generate change, who make history. Grades are important but if you are trying to be the best of the best, it can never be the only thing, it can never be enough. There are Asians who do that and they are at Harvard today.

Asia is the largest continent in the world which comprises of India, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China and many other nations. If they specifically mean Americans of Chinese or Japanese or Korean etc. ethnicity than they should say so in the first place. I am an Asian and majority of the people are moulded to work hard by the society. They are trained by their parents, their school and their society to be boring when compared to the society in the west. Everyone has a herd following mentality. The Asian society follows instead of leading in general. So everyone works hard, everyone learns a musical instrument, everyone wants they kid to get into a high paying career (not necessarily just doctor and lawyer, just high paying job).\n I agree with one of the poster. The plaintiffs instead of focusing on their success or changing themselves are complaining on discrimination due to race. Most probably because they couldn't fulfill their parents dream or meet the society's demand. However, the reality is that they are who they are due to the environment they grew up in. Asians are not boring or uninteresting. However, if you are boring and uninteresting person, that is who you are. ACCEPT AND IT AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK CHANGE IT. \nOn the contrary lot of Asians do end up going to Harvard. 19% of Harvard's students are Asians (2nd Highest group after Whites, as per US Dept of Education).﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "The Jumbo-Jet Driver"}

Asian countries are extremely homogenous. People who grow up individualistic cultures dont get this. Cant conceive it. Just how much people are like each other. I live in South Korea and have for years. Like China and other Asian countries people here are EXTREMELY homogenous. They all live the exact life. Almost everyone marries by a certain age. No need for rings because people know if youre past a certain age you are married. Everyone married has kids. Every kid particpates in the same activities. All middle school girls wear the exact same hair style. Like 99%. To them this isnt weird. They are all obsessed with studying even if their kids have learbing difficulties because they want exactly what everyone else has. No one takes a different path. They are the majority. They all want their kids to go to the top universities in the countries regardless of their kids grades. They want them to graduate and work at one of like 3 companies regardless of competiton. This is how Asian cultures are. Even if a handful of people dont fit this, they arent the rule. \n\nThese people then go to the US. and do the same. They choose Harvard for one reason: status and bragging rights.  They want to lord it over family memebers back home. Because when kids go to ivy leagues the parents feel like it reflects well on them. \n\nThen you have the problem of Asians CHOOSING no to particpate in many different fields and jobs that put other races on the map. Havard has all kinds of famous and notorious people associated with their school. Presidents, heads of companies, inventors, scientist. People who changed the world. In the last 80 years in America every other sizable racial group, minority group has engaged in social and poltical change in a memorable way EXCEPT asians. The first non white president was black. The next will be hispanic. Asians by a whole choosing not to get involved with change or making huge impacts on the world. \n\nIts not a coincidence that the vast majority of Asian in america have the same academic resumes.

However, even then, \"hard work\" as you seem to characterize it is not particularly useful in the real world. In truth, it is not the hardest workers who are the most successful, it is the smartest workers. Harvard doesn't want you to come to college and just read your textbooks all day, they want you to network, build your resume, and build your character. The reference to hard work is moreso an allusion to hours spent doing nothing but studying than anything else.\n\n2) Harvard is the number 1 pre-med school so they're not exactly in a shortage of students who want to be doctors, thus, they might want to admit applicants with different aspirations so as to promote a more diverse  atmosphere within it's gates. Also, Doctors don't make nearly enough to be significant donors but that's definitely not what Harvard was thinking either way.\n\n3) Harvard is not MIT or Cal-tech. Harvard is not a STEM school, it is a liberal arts school. We're all required to take 4 or so classes outside of our major because Harvard wants to make each one of it's students as close to the \"Renaissance man\" of an earlier day as is feasibly plausible when mass-producing diplomas. Harvard believes the person who knows a lot about one thing and s bit about everything else is more powerful than the person who knows a little more about that one thing but close to nothing about anything else. Whether or not you agree with that is another question but the best way to pursue such an educational standard would be to admit those with such immeasuranle qualities as \"creativity,\" and \"writing.\" Mind you, these are also two of the qualities that produce some of the world's most successful people.﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Moaz Selim"}

The 21st century workplace is looking for qualities like collaboration, an accurate assessment of one's own strengths, creative problem-solving, interest in learning new things, and innovation. A well-rounded university applicant should not only be academically capable but should also demonstrate some of these competencies as well. Students that put marks above all else and sacrifice opportunities in the pursuit of a perfect grade are missing out on way too many opportunities to develop socially, emotionally, and cognitively.

You have to be perfect on paper as far as grades and the second coming of Christ just to get in. Colleges don't just look at numbers, as you can see by the comments made. The NBA does. They don't care what color you are, they want the best of the best and will pay for it. A large population of athletes who play basketball in America happen to be black. If there's more playing, of course there's a higher chance they will make up a majority of who go pro. You discredit any athlete who has made it in the NBA because you claim their race helped them get in. They don't look for blacks, they look for exceptional athletes that are backed by statistics. So many kids work hard their whole lives for stellar grades and don't get into their dream college. Just because you work hard doesn't guarantee you a spot. That's what competition is. You have to stand out. You think your 4.2 GPA is special? It isn't and there are hundreds just like you. Blacks typically make up the smallest demographic of schools like Harvard. They may make up around 3 to 10% (which I think is a generous estimate, although it could be slightly higher) of Ivy League colleges. They are hardly doing any damage to other students. Why is that? Many blacks in the US are STILL subject to poor schooling with high dropout rates. They lack funding for the proper or even standard materials. Even if they have the grades, many choose not to apply because they can't afford it. In places like Harvard, it's obvious POC are hardly benefiting from affirmative action. So many people get into college for unfair reasons. Hardly anyone mentions kids who get in just for being an athlete or someone who got in just because their parents were alumni who donate money. College admissions won't be fair until we fix our ENTIRE education system to put EVERYONE on an equal playing field. Your quality of education and ability to reach your potential should not be defined by your parents income or zip code, race, etc. Whether affirmative action stays or not, some group will always suffer if we don't fix the root of the problem.﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "dahv rodriguez"}

I would argue the reason the nba is mostly black is because of institutional racism. Blacks weren't allowed to play in the nba and it used to be all white. Then our society was slowly desegregated. However blacks were often denied enrollment or harassed in order to prevent desegregation in schools. The only one's that were allowed to make it through at first, especially at private institutions, were athletes.

But many European countries, like Germany - where I am from - for example do not have such a big distinction between good and bad universities. While there are popular schools in the big cities, one problem there is the price for a flat, which is not provided by the uni itself. And because you can study somewhere cheaper without it making much difference for your later job, a lot of lower income families send there kid to a uni in a cheaper town. Distance to your home is also a big factor, as students from the north are usually staying somewhere in the north for studying, just to see their families more often. We do not have problems with admissions to universities as a whole institution, but rather with specific subjects. You can study math at pretty much every school with an average GPA (Abischnitt). If you wanna do medicine or psychology, you need much higher grades, regardless of where you want to study. And one big problem is that the average GPA and high school curriculum in general varies a lot between states, giving students from some states an unfair advantage. also, if you come from a problematic social background, you have almost no chance to tell admission offices about why your grades might have been a bit lower than those of others, even if you had to work a lot to support your family or help raise your younger siblings...

Discriminating against Asians, or in favor of these minorities, is perfectly legal so long as the process doesn't involve specific quotas.\n\nThis policy is exercised in the college admissions process by a lot of colleges. Even those colleges that don't officially adhere to \"Affirmative Action\" still have their own kinds of policies to ensure diversity at their campuses through various strategies. The main trend we're seeing is that colleges have a lot of implicit biases that may hurt or benefit an applicant depending on their race. The fact that colleges are so secretive about their admissions processes, in addition to the constant denial of any bias, makes it hard for anyone to draw a solid conclusion over whether there is tangible bias on the basis of race. \n\nEven if they do find racially-motivated bias in Harvard's admissions process, other schools will likely just find another way to label their diversity-promoting policies in order to avoid the same legal consequences.

I went to an ivy league school and there were tons of entitled kids from new England prep schools, who didn't care about minorities (except for recruiting the token minority for their frat or sorority) and just wanted to go into finance or investment banking. Where are the comments \"Of course he wants to go into investment banking\". Ivy league schools are literally filled with these kids, where were the bland and uninteresting comments for them? So it's okay to be bland and uninteresting when you display stereotypical privileged \n/prep school white traits?\n\nI grew up in California, surrounded by asian people. The stereotypes don't stop at admissions. The moment I got on campus, I was painted with a broad brush -- people (even other minorities) expected me to be quiet and smart with no personality. I got so exhausted with constantly having to prove I'm not a stereotype. Sometimes I'm tired, pulled an all nighter and don't want to talk. I'm automatically labeled a quiet asian girl. Why do I have to display hyper white traits just so I can avoid being painted with a large brush? I was born in America. I can be courageous and bold and have no problems striking up conversations with anyone. I stand up on buses for old people and go out of my way to help people. I tip generously. Sometimes I can be introverted. Sometimes I only tip 10% when the service was absolutely awful. I do it because it is ME, not because I am asian. I am so tired of fighting people's assumptions of me.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I've always thought of it like this: \n\nWhen colleges implemented affirmative action policies in their admissions processes, the size of the pool of admitted students didn't significantly change. Thus, it is fair to continue to view the admission process as a zero-sum game. For example, considering all else equal, the acceptance of one student due to excellent grades necessarily implies the rejection of another due to inferior grades. If we apply this to race, then obviously some group of students will be discriminated against as a direct result of affirmative action. If one student's application value is increased because he/she belongs to a certain race, then another student's application value is necessarily decreased because he/she does not belong to that race, since they both can't get in in every scenario where all other application components are equal. From my observations and research, this group is Asian Americans.\n\nWith that said, I do believe there is tremendous value in the diversity offered from affirmative action policies. I think effectively balancing that value with its inadvertent negative consequences is a tricky problem that is far from a clear solution.﻿", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "John Schlachtenhaufen"}

If Harvard wants a particular type of student and you don't fit that criteria too bad. You may get excellent grades, but HARVARD WANTS MORE THAN THAT.

They rejected that one person for being quiet when being a quiet person has nothing to do with anything. Many of the smartest people are quiet....and that isn't even an adequate reason to reject someone.  It's obvious they are rejecting them on purpose but to me it looks like they are rejecting them because they can tell they can't change them into what they want.

Just look at the change in demographics of UC schools, which banned Affirmative Action in Nov 1996. \n\nAccording to the University of California Office of the President admission stats: Between 1997 and 2010, across all UC schools, total Black enrollment went from 3.8% to 3.7%, Chicano/Latino enrollment dipped a bit from 12.7% and bounced back to 20.7%, Asian enrollment went from 36.4% to 39.8%, and White enrollment dropped 40.2% to 26.8%!\n\nAt UC Berkeley specifically, from 1997 to 2018, Black enrollment dropped from 7.1% to 3.1%, Latino enrollment dipped from 13.2% to 8% but bounced back to 14.6%, Asian enrollment went from 41% to 44.1%, and White enrollment from 29% to 21.3%. Again, the largest percentage point drop seen by Whites.\n\nBlack and Latino students are already small percentages so if they do experience any drop, it is minuscule (At Berkeley, it's a difference of 50 to 80 students, for whites this is a difference of a couple hundred).﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "David Boucard"}

It's interesting that you frame Affirmative Action as White/Asian vs. Black/Latino, when in fact, everyone benefits from Affirmative Action except for Asians. As I pointed out with the UC stats, Whites benefit the MOST and do so, at the expense of Asians. So allow me to include what you conveniently excluded, in the way you framed your question: Why do Asians have to score 140 points more on the SAT than Whites?

The class of 1997 does not differ significantly from 1996, 1995, 1994, etc. (Don't take my word for it. Do your own research.)  \n\nYou cite other factors, but there is no evidence for a change as substantial as banning Affirmative Action across ALL UC schools. If I missed such a factor, be specific on which one. Name such a policy. The most significant change to admissions was in fact, Prop 209 - the Affirmative Action ban.\n\nThe only other major change I can think of, is the Common App which first went online in 1998.

If it is, then there is a problem in the Admissions Office's thinking, if not then the selection procedure may be justified. The kids that applied to Harvard from my high school did not have the same pedigree as those that did not. Black, white, hispanic, asian -- people know if they are Harvard material or not. Asian parents do not just monolithically force their kids to apply to Ivy league schools. That is a stereotype in and of itself... Thus I do not think the Asian applicant pool is as diverse as others may contend. For the same reasons, one wouldn't expect a student solely interested in the humanities to apply for admission at CalTech, the pool of applicants to Harvard may represents a niche portion of the population in which a certain type of individual (e.g. \"cookie cutter\" pre-med applicants) may be overrepresented.﻿", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "Patrice-Morgan Ongoly"}

The main trend we're seeing is that colleges have a lot of implicit biases that may hurt or benefit an applicant depending on their race.

To our so called American belief, diversity in people is a capitalistic strategy to attract students from all over the states (and yes the US is stereotypically capitalistic nation- you can see it various things and even in micro-society observation wise). If the place is not diverse, then there would be a social issue like the case about the sorority at Alabama state univ. They think why the sorority is all white race is due to racism. Also the white man who graduated from 99% black university, there are backlash against him. Saying he graduated from a black university meaning there's the stereotype that he only got valedictorian because hes white.. all sorts of that stuff. Racism mostly....

I think I am qualified to speak on both sides of the coin because I have seen and lived them, I can speak my native language fluently, but I can blend into western society easily. I'm not saying everyone else has this, because it was a matter of how I grew up and the timing of my childhood. But almost every single one of you are so mistaken in the comments. You really think Asians are uninteresting??? Jokes on you. Just because you have no idea about anything in their culture? Even if you live in an Asian country for years you will never understand the culture until you really learn how to communicate with them. Because it runs deeper than anything you know. There are languages being spoken that have existed longer than white people have been on earth. What would you really know about a person coming from a culture that you know nothing about if all you know is stereotypes? Can u even connect with a person in their own language? Highly Doubtful, but the funny thing is this Asian person probably speaks English better and more fluently than you do, and can probably do the job better too. 🤷🏽‍♂️The reason you think on such a basic level like this is because you think you know all about the world and everyone else when u haven't taken the time to learn anything other than what was \"taught\" to you.

Em no...there are 40.000 other applicants with almost the same scores as yours.

Because the first one has life experiences, maturity and shows responsibility. Those are the trades you need in life. Will anyone ask you what was your GPA, when you'll look for a job or will they look at other qualities? \n\nSo, let's say Harvard gets 20.000 Asian applicants with perfect scores and they are better than majority of others. Well I would set a limit too, or consider other application criteria. If I would be admitting, I would pick a black guy who is a great chef, white girl with international gymnastics medals, Indian kid with great networking skills, Asian girl with great drawing skills, etc... Not 2.000 Asians because their GPA and test scores were better than others! I would pick people with passion for what they do from various backgrounds. It would also be a way more stimulating environment for growth on campus, that 2.000 people that only care about their grades. And that's what they are doing and that's why all the nerds with no life are offended. Hosts of this video even expect them to come up with a \"grading criteria\" for personality...wow...\n\nSo honestly, I don't blame Harvard for wanting racially DIVERSE campus. I would do the same.

Like it's ok to to hold people back for being too succesfull, unless it's the group you blame for your problems. For example women typically have higher collage admission rates than men, because society makes it easier for them to persue academic success.

Instead, what they are good at is mastering how to perform well in an existing system. Of course, this is a generalisation, I make this claim based on my own observation.﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Runze"}

You found lies to perpetuate instead of a stereotype like “all black people can dance” or something. \n\n2. Black is a skin color that was invented during the time when evolution was beginning to be theorized about meant to specifically to demonstrate they were barely above monkeys and, therefore, barely human. The term “Asian” is a super broad label that more closely denotes culture rather than skin color. \nThat’s why black people have never been able to integrate with society despite having been in the US for about as long as the early-defined white people have been and contributed tremendously to American culture to make it distinct. \nIt is absolutely not okay to perpetuate these same lies that dehumanize a huge population. \nGermans, Irish, and Italians were all called natural criminals when they first arrived. Italians even had movies made about their criminal activities. That’s because when a group is heavily discriminated against, often times the only recourse they have is crime. (The rare exceptions are Jews and Asians, which is why we tend to get lumped together and are rewarded with the negative label as misers.) \nSo when you see a group tending towards crime, this is why that happens. No one is naturally criminal. \n\nThe difference between black people and these groups is that these groups were eventually integrated and accepted and granted the high evolution label of “white” when they were, while black people have not despite the fact that America loves black culture. \n\nBlack people certainly did not have such high incarceration rates or dare I say been so poor in the 20th and 21st century before the 1980s.﻿", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "JL J"}

Black and brown people cross land borders or came in slave ships. Structural and systemic poverty and racism has meant that black and brown people have had a much harder time getting into good schools. If you’re from a wealthier area your chances are much higher because you’re just better developed and have more resources. Asians are by and large from middle and upper middle class families. They don’t experience structural racism in the same way black people do. I went to a UC school. It was flooded with Asians. You want your school to be 80% Asian just because Asians are obsessively focused on academics and don’t develop personalities? Uh no thanks. The elite institutions of American life will always be racist because the top schools lead to the very best jobs. Harvard has what percentage of white people? Im guessing it’s in the 90-95% range. If schools are discriminating against Asians it’s because there are way too many Asians relative to other minority groups. And Asians don’t think their academic ability is related to their economic class and the fact that again they immigrated here which means they already are people with more resources than other minority groups. If we want actual meritocracy we need to make the rich and corporations pay the same tax rates they paid in the 40s-70s, back when schools medicine and housing were far cheaper and more affordable. That would result in different groups having more equal opportunity to succeed. Instead we have a situation where Asians are angry they can’t swarm harvard like the Zerg in Starcraft. Asians want to pretend that race isn’t a factor for other minority groups, but then when it comes to them they want to be able to claim they are oppressed in the same way black people are. Really dumb especially because Asians live in the same prosperous communities white people do.

Asian students are being held back by traits that would be considered normal in other students. If an applicant who is an underrepresented minority said they wanted to be a doctor (an extremely high percentage of incoming college students are premed, which ties into the idea of cookie cutter), would they be categorized as unfairly as Asian Americans (hint: no)? If someone honestly judges Asian Americans as cookie cutter and not interesting because of preconceived and dated stereotypes, they are racist.\n\nYour comment is the equivalent of saying all latinos students suck (but it’s not their fault so I’m not racist) because they were raised in an environment that has a lot of drug dealing.

If the same issue is reported again, further testing is done to replicate the fault electronically. If the issue isn't replicated electronically, the plane is pulled from service and flight tested to find the fault dor resolution. That said, not all countries/airlines follow such strict protocol.\n\nNo matter the cause, lessons must be learned from this deadly accident. So sad.﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Cameron Hollis"}

That wearable keyboard isn't the best I have seen, but I do think that there are legitimate uses for one handed input.  \n\nI think that the future will have a wide variety of inputs for the standard user.  Even today with traditional PC's we can have a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, voice input, ect. all in one device.

{"cid": "Ugz6n1F_bulRDkI2g9d4AaABAg", "text": "I respectfully disagree with your views on using voice typing when it comes to speaking language. I think using Machine learning and with enough data, we can teach AI(which will learn itself on the process) and recognize voice tones/ pitches and how we speak and automatically put questions marks and other annotations along the way. Moreover, it could also scan the complete sentence and do corrections on its own in real-time. So, I think it's possible, maybe not now but soon enough. And if this becomes reality then keyboards are indeed going to be obsolete. \n\nAnd yeah when it comes to writing long paragraphs or composing papers ( as the professor said: speech will interfere with part of your brain). I think this change is not going to happen just overnight, this will change gradually not exponentially and our mind will also accept the changes slowly and will function accordingly.\n\nPS:- I'm just a beginner when it comes to AI and stuff and it's just my own thought.

Regarding resting your hands: there's surely an option to switch from standby to on.\n\nQwerty is not efficient; an above average typer, types with 100 wpm. On a stenograph you can type with 225 wpm, that's well above average speaking speed. And the reason why you can type so fast is because you are typing with combinations.\n\nThe qwerty keyboard was not as someone said designed for simplicity or efficiency; It was designed for typewriters, so that common words wouldn't make the parts stuck to each other. Someone who can type seriously on a keyboard never relies on looking at the keys. \n\nTell me was it really so easy learning to type on a keyboard for the first time? Associating a position on a keyboard with a letter takes up the same information in our brains as with a combination of fingers.\n\nTo be clear I don't think this product will replace qwerty, but you didn't seem to listen to the video; the intention of this product was to be able to type while using VR.

{"cid": "UgyjJyQ-RTe7Tp_bIkt4AaABAg", "text": "Yeah, how about no? Voice typing sort of works for phones, but you can't use it for a bunch of things. You'll never write code with voice, you'll never say your password with voice, and you can't use it in public well, etc. Tap typing, in my opinion is just stupid. You don't get any type of haptic response and there's no point in using it over a regular keyboard. And if you want to use it as a replacement for your phone keyboard, you firstly need a flat, even surface, and you could just use a swipe keyboard and it would be about 1000 times more convenient. As for just sensing your hands in VR, firstly, you're probably not going to be using keybaords in VR for the most part, and second, you still don't get that haptic response unless you have some full body VR suit that you can interact with like the keyboard was actually there. Thanks, but I like my keyboard.﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Two Sided Polygon"}

{"cid": "UgxL-FMt-zwX00b300R4AaABAg", "text": "A keyboard is much more than typing text messages in a specific language, which is pretty much the focus of the video. You use your computer to play games, watch videos, surf the web, read books, listen to music. The keyboard is the universal peripheral that fits all current use cases. For example, I can't see people playing games or writing computer code by dictating everything to a speech recognition software. Also, you have special peripherals that were designed for specific use cases that the keyboard is not the best option, such as the many game controllers that exist to play different kinds of games, or the tablets and pens people use to draw.\n\nTo think of a replacement for the keyboard is very hard. Just think about the keyboards that allegedly have better key layouts, such as the DVORAK. Even though it may make you more productive, people still refuse to use it because it is not as intuitive or ubiquitous as the QWERTY keyboard. And the DVORAK is still a keyboard. Imagine then, introducing a whole new peripheral. Will people actually adopt it?﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Douglas De Rizzo Meneghetti"}

This would prove to be a serious fire risk in the pressurised, oxygen rich capsule.\n\nFor a while, mechanical pencils were favored by NASA; however, these too are dangerous. Stray graphite dust is impossible to gather, highly flammable and conductive–just about the worst thing possible to be floating around in a spacecraft with sensitive electronics that are keeping people alive.\n\nAnother issue is that pencils simply aren’t that effective in space. Without gravity to allow the graphite to settle, pencil etchings were prone to severe smearing, making them fairly worthless for permanent documentation. The Russians did use pencils for a brief time, which did not pose the risk to electronics but still suffered from all the other problems, and the paper shrouds used created a lot of flammable waste.\"\n\nAs for the movie part, well it was a bit stupid because it was a comedy movie.

If you dig deep into it (start on page 86 with their balance sheet), you'll see that they have very little actual cash on hand, only $7B, compared to their liabilities, $668B. While this huge disparity would be fine for some other firm that sells a widget to make money, Lehman Brothers sold money (in the form of loans) to make money (off the interest). Having such a small amount of cash in the vault translated to bigger profits to shareholders (yay!) but also exposed Lehman Brothers to the risk that they might not be able to cover their liabilities if the market started to shake. \n\nTo their credit, management even identified this risk in their \"Liquidity Risk\" discussion, but only go so far as to say they have a 'liquidity pool.'\n\nAnyway, this video was incredibly insightful!﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "chuckoddwalla"}

Got me wondering what the balance sheet of GS looked like during the same time. Goldman had roughly $11.8B cash compared to $1.08T in liabilities, so close to the same cash/liabilities ratio as Lehman at the time. Perhaps there are more distinctive red flags to be found on the Lehman balance sheet that indicates that the company was in real trouble. \n\nplease let me know if you know of any other red flags, would be interesting to analyze and maybe contrast with similar companies like GS.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Patrick Campbell"}

I personally think the best thing we all can learn from Buffet is to try and be happy and content, regardless of where we are in life.  Buffet does travel a lot more than the average person, he has had the opportunity to meet a lot of interesting people in his life and he is respected throughout the world.  At the end of the day though, he basically lives no different than any of us do in his upper middle class home in Omaha.  More than anything else, I think Buffet teaches us to follow four simple rules.\n\n1. Invest in yourself.\n2. Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.\n3. Try and enjoy life.\n4. Stay humble.\n\nI think these four rules sum up Buffet's success pretty well.

Multi vid layers??\n\nAnd finally, Does the i9 run 4K while editing like the 2017 i7 could run and edit 1080p?? \n\nI’m fine with waiting a few extra minutes etc regarding rendering etc, but if you can’t actually edit 4K video and have smooth playback, be able to add solid plugins, and edit multi layers of vid without jitters and or audio drops and all of it what would be the point!\nI just purchased a 2017 i7 2.9 and can still return it for the i9 if you think it’s worth it to do so??! 👍🏼\n\nThanks big time for your help!﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "MylesTube 5"}

Even with previous gen models, not a good idea to casually cause the thing that can F up your keyboard. If you have a disposable income, perhaps that is nothing to you, but as for myself, if I had an expensive machine like that, I would make sure to be careful with it. This video irresponsibly highlights and encourages neglecting caution with highly expensive laptops. Just because something clears up an issue doesn't mean that it couldn't come back because you provoke it. It's better to have a company be responsible for hardware malfunction, not you. Also, keyboards aren't the most important thing on a laptop, but they are an important piece of hardware in communicating with the computer.﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Agustin Gamez"}

{"cid": "UgyjcuGgv7leD31N2VV4AaABAg", "text": "Instead of criticizing them, we should be learning from them; they have figured out a better way to be imperialistic. The way that we did things using the private sector left the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer, and had HUGE corruption. We got what we wanted from those countries, but their people HATED us for exploiting them. The way that China is operating is largely improving things for the people of those countries, and they end up loving China for it.\nThe old school imperialist model was to invade or strike deals with corrupt strongmen, and then take what we want (extract resources or set up bases), and left the people in those countries worse off than before. We would often interfere with the country's internal politics to support whoever would play ball with us, regardless of how horrible that they were. China is still doing the same stuff (extracting resources and setting up bases), but they stay out of internal politics in the country, and instead of paying leaders, they directly invest in the country in ways that benefit the populace (infrastructure, education, etc.). That is why, although the outcome is the same for the imperialist power (extracting resources and setting up strategic bases), the outcome is much different for the country being exploited; those countries' populations also largely love China, whereas they hated us and our imperialist predecessors. We need to learn that privatization and interfering with internal politics is a bad way of doing things, and take a page from China's book. Invest directly in countries instead of buying off leaders, and have the work in those countries be done by government agents rather than private business (because they will be more accountable).\nFor example, say that there is an African or Middle Eastern country that has something that we want (resources or the location for a trade/military base); the US would buy off the corrupt political leader if one exists, or have them overthrown if not. We would send in our companies, which would get rich while leaving the population of the country poor, and likely worse off (kicking them out of their homes, ruining their local environment, etc.). Now say that China similarly want something from that same country (resource or base); they pay for it by building infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.), and providing schools, hospitals, etc. to the country. They send in government agents, and the population ends up slightly better off than before (and given their situation, that is a HUGE improvement in their eyes). That is why third world countries exploited by the US hate us, while third world countries exploited by China love them.\nIn short, we did imperialism better than the UK and France did, and now China is doing it better than we did. Instead of trying to stifle them or get hostile because they are replacing us, we should learn from them and bring them into the fold, like the UK and France did with us. History shows that when the declining power fights the rising power, they not only lose, but end up weaker or even destroyed. The old imperial powers are largely still players on the world stage because they learned that lesson, and decided to work with us when we were the rising power, and they were declining. Now that China is the rising power, instead of retreating into nationalism and fighting them, we should follow the UK and France's examples, and work with them- we can draft off of their headwind, and remain a large player. In other words, instead of trying to fight for 1st place, and ending up in fifth or lower, we should graciously let them take the lead, so that we can remain 2nd, and leave the huge gap between us and 3rd place.﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "quantumperception"}

Even tourist are banned bringing Chinese currency for shopping in China. Only enter with US dollars. All having Chinese paper are confiscated on the spot. China sells only in US dollars all their export. Check Alibaba site says all exports Letters of Credit must in US dollar. No other currency. Not even if you have tons of Chinese paper currency. Not interested. Can you believe it,  if you have Chinese notes, Chinese banks will not accept their own printed money to buy Chinese made goods? Only US dollars. With US$ China is a failed beggar State. President Trump has put heavy tariffs 200% on all China export to the US paid in US dollars. China has been fooling the world for a long time by selling fake goods for US$. All made in China last for only a month. Cheap quality for your dollar.

China isn’t funding infrastructure projects in Africa with an “Africa First” mindset, they will always put the Chinese people and Chinese interests First, whenever dealing with other nations. \rRemember CHINA IS NOT AFRICA\"S FRIEND BUT A COMPETITOR\n\nTherefore, Africa must see China as a Competitor and not as a friend. African governments must realize that the economic future of the Africa, isn’t dependent on the generosity of the Chinese, but dependent on the tenacity and ability of African leaders to deliver good governance and leadership to the African people. We also cannot depend on the West as they have rapped the African continent int the past.

{"cid": "UgzqsCu4ugzwKBPNsVN4AaABAg", "text": "Before you think China are saints or better than the USA, let's go over what they have done.\n\n1) Mao (their first communist leader) took private properties and killed capitalists in his country.\n\n2) Their current 'president' has removed the term limit in their constitution. He is now president for life.\n\n3) The Chinese government has caused a serious crackdown on freedom of speech to the point of using live ammunition on a group of students.\n\n4) Every religious institution is meant to believe in the CCP. If you believe in your God, you will either have your church destroyed or you will be sent to a special place to be reeducated on how wrong you are (it's a concentration camp). \n\n5) The Chinese government are breaching treaties both in international waters and Taiwan and Singapore. If you do not know, Taiwan and Singapore are under treaties that states they are a part of China BUT they can operate their own system of government. China is breaking that treaty slowly. \n\n6) Chinese camps have been found to forcefully take the organs of Chinese people.\n\n7) China arrested the interpol chairman (a Chinese man) and kept his whereabouts a secret from the world despite the man's leadership role in the world. When they eventually did admit what they did, they were vague on the charges against him.\n\n8) China has come to the 'rescue' of poor European countries in massive debts by putting them in more debts. These European countries are then influenced by China to veto votes against any policies that targets China by the European Union. \n\n9) China creates debt traps. Many Africans in the comments fail to understand what a debt trap is. You can get that development you want BUT you will always have to be in favor of China even if they do something wrong like pollute your air like Beijing (China's capital). How this works is when China gives a loan that country money that the country cannot pay, China then ask for key sectors in your country and your country will have no other choice but to comply. \n\nI think I've said enough. If my fellow brothers and sisters in Africa believe China is still the best, then let that country come and assist your country. But I will advise you to check your country's GDP and its debts and then think about if your governments can pay off those debts with additional ones. You may see China taking a few sectors as nothing. But once they have control of your seaports, airports, national monuments and engage in lawmaking in your country, you will then realize what a mistake you made.﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Max The Character"}

Those natives can definitely proclaim that they have better living via roads, rails ,bridges etc for economic progress and their lives can expand. \nWhat CHINA has accomplished only infuriate the west, especially US with hate, jealousy, bitterness and restlessness. One can sense this heinous aura hidden in the speeches of us defence sec, us state sec, etc including that us mad dog. \n2) The rise of CHINA is one \"bitter pill\" which the Americans find so devilish to swallow so much  so  that the mad dog introduced trade tariff,  sanctions on CHINA with hope to topple CHINESE economy. However, trade tariff and sanction, etc are imposed on other countries unfavourable to US interest and security. \nThe Americans believe their economy is still the top of the world - SWEET DREAM!!

I don't see the US government sending ((US citizens)) to 'reeducation camps' (concentration camps) to be 'reeducated' (tortured) because they called Donald Trump an idiot, or British Citizens being sent to concentration camps because they opposed Theresa May, or German citizens being sent to camps because they were opposed to Angela Merkle. I don't see Christians, Jews, Muslims or Buddhists being beaten and dragged away by police to reeducation camps because they believe in God, Jesus or Allah instead of idolising their country's leader. I don't see western nations actively trying to block every movie, tv show or image that may possibly make the country or government look bad. I don't see western nations blocking websites and banning books because it might provoke free thought and skepticism or god forbid prompt citizens to think for themselves and question government decisions. What makes this worse is the fact that the CCP isn't doing this to another nation's citizens, its doing it to their own. Their own citizens. Their own people. It amazes me how you can just brush this off with \"oh well thats just how they deal with their issues\". No, that is a corrupt authority trying to maintain its power. And you think its okay for a government that does this to have economic, and eventually political and social control, over all these other nations? And you proceed to go after all these other nations and point out what bad they have done, all the while hypocritically depicting China as a saint? The US and Europe have not been very good to Africa. That is obvious. But China is far from the saint you are describing it as. It has the same agenda, the same motive, with an arguably more corrupt government behind it. Its just more cunning than the US and Europe were. Wake up Randolph. You cannot defend what the CCP has done. I am utterly amazed how you tried to defend the CCP's actions.

Western countries had given various kind of aids to African nations but most of them end up in warlords' pockets. At least now these developing countries and their people do get benefits from China's BRI as good infrastructure are the foundation of future growing. Roads, bridges and ports China built will increase connectivity between different regions, which also increase tradings and cultural exchanges. Even if these nations can't pay China back in cash, they can still give resources and political favors to China, and those infrastructures will be left there for them to use. Of course China is no saint. But unlike those hypocritical capitalists and politicians in the west who never really want to invest in poor countries because of concerns over investment returns and \"human-right issues\", China is not seeking to change governments or get returns of investment. BRI will not only help China economically but also politically in the long run.\r\nIn my opinion, the so-called Indo-Pacific project is just too little too late and the alliance between so-called Quad is pitifully weak. Japan and Australia are competing with the US companies for the market of growing middle-income class in China. At lease Japan has already struck deals with China in trade and technology cooperation, Japan is also preparing to join BRI very soon. And the tough stance Australia holds against China could change after next election.

African countries don't need aid, they need investment. China gets that, the West hasn't gotten then and it still refuses to open it's markets to African goods.\n\n\"Undermining African economy\". Africa is not a country, it's a continent with many different countries each with it's own unique government, its own unique Central bank, it's own unique market and resources and people, it's own unique economy and its own unique relationship with China. If you even don't that fact, that is already telling a lot about where you statement and mind frame is coming from! From complete ignorance of what is actually happening on the ground.\n\nFurthermore, it is because of their relationships with China that many African economies like Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Mozambique and many, many others are booming and growing at some of the fastest growth rates in the world.\n\nIn some instances there have been problems with over borrowing from the Chinese government by local govenments. However, for the most part this economic growth has been taking place due to partnerships between Chinese private and government firms with local govenments and private businesses in mutual beneficiary deals. Furthermore, Chinese investment has stimulated the birth and growth of many local African enterpreneurs and businesses across the entire continent and spur the growth and birth of many industries and different markets. In addition, Chinese investment has built and is helping build critical infrastructure that will create incentive further investment from other parts of the world who now see that they can now do business in many of these parts of the world. \n\nHowever China's relationship with Africa is unique because China itself was a underdeveloped country just recently. \n\nIf you have any doubts just go to many Chinese industrial hubs in China and look at the tens of thousands, or the even hundreds of thousands of African businessmen and businesswomen, buying and selling goods and services in China from China and to China as the same is taking place with Chinese businessmen and women in many African countries.

Examples of such Youtubers are Phillip DeFranco (a man who reports the news internationally), Daily Wire (A popular conservative editorial), PragerU (A conservative channel that speaks about the history of America through their view), Steven Crowder (A TV talkshow host who exposed Antifa as a violent group), Some Black Guy and many other YouTube channels. \n\nYou need to look up the history of YouTube than making false information. China Uncensored is not making profit because it tells lies but because it talks about politics (Chinese politics). CNN can get away with it since they're a big network.\n\nDebt traps don't spring all at once. It takes time before it reveals itself since loans always have a deadline. Besides, some countries can reach alternative agreement with China to compensate without losing key sectors in their country. Greece (not a part of the Belt and Road initiative) fell into huge debt and had to go to China to preserve itself from collapse. The same went for smaller European countries and China has used them to stop votes in the European Union that targets China in a bad light. For instance, these smaller countries stopped a vote in the EU that criticises China's forced organ harvesting. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that China is a COMMUNIST country. While they have adopted some capitalism, communism is still dominant since the communist party controls Chinese businesses rather than letting the free market to decide. I will also remind you that China has strict and severe crackdown on protests, freedom of speech and freedom of religion in their country. While the United States can bring up human rights problems in a country as a cause for not doing business with that country, China will do business with that country regardless if that country's leader is a fat dictator who would allow his people to starve to death than actually do something about it (North Korea and Venezuela). So don't think for a second that China is doing the One Belt and One Road Initiative in the kindness of their own heart or just for financial profit.

China has been trying to get cooperation out of India for awhile. Modi doesnt appear to dislike Xi. Rather, he seems divided between a few distinct political issues. The first being satisfying the Hindutva types while still appealing to developing city-dwelling secularists. India is very diverse. China by contrast is clear cut atheistic and has many ethnicities that ultimately identify as Chinese. It makes balancing decisions a lot easier for Xi. But in the end, I think most politicians in India understand they dont have a unified system and it would be hard to reach the development wanted. Despite this, India is certainly balancing the insane amount of political topics it must...which is why anyone who talks ill of India might benefit from more research. It's a very impressive place. \n\nJapan is coddling up to generate more development projects. It isnt an easy thing to balance. Japan doesnt have much to offer China but services. China already has services. They open new tickets in the market daily. What can Japan do? Bring electronics for one. Ultimately, Japan has to court China in a way that they know they'd be losing more than they gain. However, a gain is a gain. In an economy like Japan's, beggars cant be choosers. \n\nWith the ROK-DPRK relationship reaching newer developments, I also think the ROK may be more willing to open up more to Japan. Ultimately, the historic destabilizer in East Asia was Japan. A more docile Japan is showing it might be more willing to try to compete, rather than wage outright war. \n\nDuterte cant seem to make up his mind. He was a youth communist now killing off communists while wanting to do business with..  communists. Suffice to say, either the PLA is corrupt in the Philippines or China is just ok with this (I know drugs became a huge issue in the Philippines with the communists- spreading heroin from previously operational military ports). \n\nAll in all, I see India and China's border flexing as something that isnt meant as a threat, but more like two bodybuilders in a gym checking each other out.﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Neil  Wiggs"}

Many conditions were set forth that although were designed to make govt more efficient (such as reducing the size of civil service & govt spending) actually hurt us in the long run by destroying our education & healthcare systems that were too premature at the time not to be subsidised (to an extent) by government. Then in the revision of these loans, we were required to set higher domestic interest rates & taxes to fund the debt repayments which killed off local businesses & any disposable income the middle class had. Not saying beijing is better in anyway but just trying to explain the mindset so many of us have towards chinese financing that many westerners don't seem to understand. \n\nImo it's a great thing US is trying to offer an alternative but they have to learn from the mistakes of the IMF (whose foolish policies destroyed our economies, inspired coups and did nothing whatsoever to help us grow).

The USSR was going to set up nuclear missiles right off the coast of the US. So that is one threat that happened in the past. The USSR's mission was to expand communism's influence beyond Europe so the US and its allies had to contain Communism's spread to places like Greece and Egypt for example. Today that threat the USSR had on the west passed to China. Thats just a small part of what Communism has done to the US/the world. Communism is the opposite of a Republic so they naturally will come into conflict since both want to expand its influence. The US has had a long history with communism and it is viewed as a threat because Communism wants to destroy the foundations of western civilization.

They took a $100 billion USD hit for illegal practice over the years. When the settlement went down, the party owned a majority of shares in Apple in the country and even had a good finger in the U.S. \n\nChina isnt capitalist, really. It very much looks after the workers still. City-life is a little different, however. It is a known fact living in urban China isnt easy. It is simply part of the Maoist concept we still see on the Chinese flag. Class harmony. \n\nIt isnt perfect, but for the time being, China is a socialist country with a high degree of state ownership. \n\nThat said, I don't think the recent party decision to allow privatization of some parts of the energy sector.

They have clearly ignored the fact that Sri Lanka offered China a debt-for-equity deal to rectify the debt crisis. It was Sri Lanka that offered, not China. \n\nTo be honest, I don't understand why the US is upset with the way other Asian countries have accepted China's BRI initiative and other investments. For example in Sri Lanka, after the Sri Lankan Civil War, the country was shunned by the US as well as the EU. That consequently left a gap which China filled. China came in and started investing. If the US was interested and did not want China to enter countries like Sri Lanka economically and even culturally, particularly those in Asia, then they could have stepped in at the start. Warning and making references to BRI countries like Pence recently did is foolish and laughable. Where was the US almost ten years ago? Not to mention this whole \"America First\" policy has created a severe dent in the international opinion of the US. They mentioned the Quad in this video, the interesting thing is both Japan and India (two of the USA's closest Asian allies) have recently begun courting China.

{"cid": "Ugz54R1o1BodLVY97Ll4AaABAg", "text": "Trump's family is in politics, and the dog is in the sky?\r\n\r\nFirst Lady Melaniya publicly requested on the 13th, will be the Deputy National Security Adviser Mila. Mira Ricardel was dismissed and the First Lady’s Office issued a statement confirming this. Does the President’s wife intervene in government personnel and is it legally available? After Trump was elected, her daughter and son-in-law joined the government and intervened in diplomacy. The original low-key Melanie was also involved in high-level personnel this time. It seems that \"one person has a way, the whole family has risen to the sky\", is it reasonable?\r\nWhat about the role of the first lady? The United States, like other countries, is \"women with a husband\" or \"female with a woman\" (the Queen's husband is the duke). Laws and political practices give the First Lady many rights and responsibilities. In addition to participating in charitable activities, there are offices and exclusive aides in the White House to arrange various public relations trips.\r\nThe First Lady can also visit foreign countries separately, participate in national ceremonies, receive foreign guests, use national resources, such as special planes, security guards, and have a fixed budget. Melanie and Likader have had a holiday, and the report indicates that the process of visiting Africa has created a gap. However, if she is dissatisfied with the latter, she will only say \"blow the pillow and wind\" to Trump, let the White House chief of staff or Trump replace the official, and the outsiders can't see the traces.\r\nHowever, Melanie, who has always been low-key and has a similar style to Trump. After intervening in the government, he also issued a statement publicly admitting that there is such a thing, obviously too much, and the system is out of place, and even illegal. If she and Li Kader had a deep festival, they didn't know how to measure. She, the aides and Trump were as ignorant as Luke, thinking that they were \"making the emperor\" and seriously hurting Melaniya's good public image.\r\nIn the past, I have been a first lady, and there are many rumors in the market. For example, Mrs. Reagan’s Nanxun loves to find someone to enter the White House for fortune telling, Hi Lily. Clinton is more \"out of the box\" and directly involved in the president's power. But at least the impact is on the table, just as the president accepts many close friends to avoid breaking the system.\r\nMelanie is a model of Slovakia. She is famous for her show. She is a nude lady who is a socialite. Until being by the businessman Trump, became the third Mrs. Trump. Now that Trump is elected president, she is also in the early days. However, she was repeatedly photographed in the public and ignored by Trump, including the rainy day Chuanpu umbrella only to cover herself, regardless of her side of the rain; in public, Trump often walked in front, regardless of her. When Trump wanted to hold her hand, she deliberately opened Trump and let the media make a big fuss. The gossip news even said that she would divorce Trump after she left office.\r\nThe Trump family is doing things publicly, and his daughter Ivanka often accompanied Trump to visit, and he once took the position of the Lord, regardless of other national leaders on the side, and was criticized by the media for not knowing the proportion; the son-in-law Kushen involved in the high-level relations between China and the Saudi Arabian royal family. The friendship was shallow and Israel moved to Jerusalem, and the influence behind the scenes was amazing. They have senior consultants and offices in the White House. It seems that Trump has one person and the whole family has risen to heaven. It is rare for modern presidents. In the future, history will have a completely different evaluation from today.\r\nMelanie identified Likader as no longer a national security consultant. What is the reason? The latter did not respect her opinion and despised her aides. The visit did not arrange a special plane and a special team seat for the staff, or did not recognize Likader in policy? Or she just wants to beat out and not want to be an invisible person? Even the \"high-level black\" of Trump? We are waiting to see.﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "elsa KUAN"}

The politicians also let the Chinese buy a lot of land and real estate.

Only rich Chinese travel to the place now and only shop and eat at the Chinese shops and restaurants.  Most of the revenue goes back to China.

You should study how countries like Japan, South Korea, and China rise to its current economic prosperity. They all have their own share of terrible government and stupid policies (e.g. Mao Zedong in China, and Syngman Rhee in South Korea) that keep them down for many years.\nBut then they realize that it didn't work out for them and they adopt new way of thinking (mostly by adopt free market capitalism) which ultimately succeed and enable them to reach current prosperity.\n\nLook at the two Koreas (North Korea and South Korea). Both countries share same people, same culture, and same history (up to around 1953 when they are truly separated). But one is authoritarian regime (not unlike many parts of Africa), and the other is by democratic society with market economy. One is sh*thole, while the other is a one of the most vibrant and advanced society on earth.\nExact same story with west and east Germany.\n\nLook, it's not what your ancestors had invented or what culture you have, but your own way of thinking. As long as you failed to recognize your own shortcomings and blame others for your misfortune, you will not be able of study from your mistake and improve yourself.\n\nYou talk about Afghanistan, did you know that thousand years ago, the people live there and the kingdom they built was glorious and very prosperous?\nIt was known as Bactria, a very rich kingdom. Their people and culture are known and respected by surrounding Chinese, Persians and Indians alike. But look at them now, they are sit at the top of huge deposit of rare-earth minerals (which touted as the \"new gold\", or \"new oil\" due to their rising importance), but many Afghans are poor and large part of Afghanistan is a conflict-ridden sh*thole, not unlike many parts of Africa.\nIf, let's say, Swiss or Singaporeans bring their system of governance into Afghanistan, I bet Afghanistan will turn into prosperous first world country in 30-40 years. It's all about the rule of law (the supremacy of the law), efficient and effective bureaucracy, good governance and free market economy. Those are the components that always work for any type of society and culture, from the Americas, Europe, Arab world, Asia, Oceania, or wherever.

Should North Korea invent the most important thing since the last 100 years, who will they sell it to? Who will they partner with to get it to the rest of the world?\nAuthoritarianism is not what is keeping NK the way they are today. Sanctions are.\nOr do you have any government statement from North Korea stating that they don't desire to grow their economy nor do business with the rest of the world?\nHow can a nation that has been placed under decades of endless sanctions be accused of not wanting to grow like those sanctions are not there to practically LIMIT THEIR GROWTH?\nDo we have to be this dodgy with crystal clear realities of the day.\n\nYes, Empires Rise And Empires Fall. Those Middle Eastern countries were once great empires. Even Britain lost it's greatness. America will eventually lose theirs. China that is on the rise will rise to the top and still fall years later. It's simply the way of life.\n\nNow, since you're clearly a very knowledgeable guy, let's talk about \"free market\".\nWhy did Brexit happen? Cause the British felt that they were losing more than they were gaining from being part of European Union. Whether they are or not is subject of contention. But what isn't contentious is whether an imbalanced union can have a toll on one side more than the other side.\n\nAfrica was never fortunate to have had it's own conquering empires so our first forced marriage with Europeans put us at a great disadvantage where they had more to give and same time - they gained more, simply cause we lacked the exposure to know what to gain from them nor how to get them even if we did. And they kept us in that wilderness of blindness for ages.\nFast forward to modern age, they built things we didn't get to learn to build and sold them to us. The few we managed to build were unaccepted by them in a CHOICELESS ('free'?) market where they were our colonists and our leaders had to obey them.\nEven more recent years. We are now at a level where all the good things we have access to are being produced by the West. Our best scientists given visa to work in Western nations and we're are left taking in more foreign goods than we could match with our own products.\nIn my country in particular. It is within the last 20 years that recent governments have been imposing various tax on foreign goods and banning some completely to help boost local market.\nThere was never a chance for us to measure up. The West had all the aces. They knew they were gaining more from us than should be the case. \"Free market\" is what works to the advantage of the West since they already had all to offer and worked to our disadvantage since we had little besides natural resources to offer. Add that to the high level of illiteracy here then you'll see why it was never a fair play.\n\nI have been using Google since 2000. I can tell you that there is little to no actual Google physical presence here in my country. Millions rely on Google products and services here. So why can't they say \"Okay, let's go here and open up offices and hire staff\". We are talking of ultra cheap labour in case you don't know. $500 a month salary here is a big deal. I'm sure that's peanut to you guys. So labour is super cheap and not only will it save such companies money in terms of production costs, it will also help to maintain a tighter bond with the people that patronise their business. That's not charity. That's strategic thinking if you ask me.\n\nAnd that my friend, is what China is doing differently. China is creating labour here and still selling their products and services unlike Western nations who are only interested in selling.\nAnd the benefit of China's local investments is that they patronise local businesses whom they source materials from, aside the labour harvesting.\n\nHopefully now you can understand a huge part of what my problem with the West is.﻿", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "The Other Side"}

There are no marauding gangs breaking into offices or extorting money from business owners anymore than what could be found elsewhere in the world.\nAs for terrorism, that's literally a new invention Nigerians are still trying to come to terms with since it was considered a White and Arabian people's problem until some 10 years ago.\nEven at that. Only Eastern Nigeria has that problem which is a highly concentrated area for uneducated Muslims.

I recall you said similar things before. So you should have know that those African empires build their empire by conquering other people. I mean even in Nigeria, you have several different major \"tribes\" that speak their own dialect and have distinctly different culture, right?\nFor example the people of Mali was not from the same group of people to those of Songhai. So Mali conquering areas like Gao was equivalent to France invading Italy or Spain (i.e. they share similar culture, namely the romance culture, but French and Italians are not the same people).\n\nHowever, if you meant that African states never had a colonial empire, then I kinda agree (ofc we have to exclude Egypt and Berber). In any case, Korea and China too never have colonial empire. So that's not an excuse for the current inept leadership. What your ancestors did, or did not, many centuries ago, really does not (and should not) affect you now.\n\n\"I'm curious to know why you're feigning ignorance when it comes to the \"land REPOSSESSION\" issues going on in South Africa and Zimbabwe\"\nI'm not \"feigning ignorance\". IMO, those are another example of inept government that the lack an ability (or willpower) to protect private property.\nThe fact that you are using term \"REPOSSESSION\" is pretty disturbing. SA and Zimbabwe politicians fractured their own society/country by split their own people on racial line and pit one group of citizens against another. That's just IDIOTIC ACT. It will send signal to foreign investors with \"wrong skin color\" to avoid investing in said countries.\nOfc I understand about the case of apartheid in many African countries, especially in SA.

The continent has needed funds to bridge its large infrastructural deficit; thus, Africa can benefit a bit from its relationship with China. \nHowever, the Chinese are very smart people, and African leaders must deal with them cautiously and ingenuously. China is in Africa for 3 main reasons:\n1) A market for their goods. 2) Natural Resources to fuel their industries. 3) To expand their global Geo-political influence.\nChina gives African countries loans they can't pay back then makes the indebted countries pay back with national assets and resources. China isn’t funding infrastructure projects in Africa with an “Africa First” mindset, they will always put the Chinese people and Chinese interests First, whenever dealing with other nations. \nTherefore, Africa must see China as a Competitor and not as a friend. African governments must realize that the economic future of the Africa, isn’t dependent on the generosity of the Chinese, but dependent on the tenacity and ability of African leaders to deliver good governance and leadership to the African people. We must vehemently work towards an Africa that isn’t dependent on foreign countries and international organisations for infrastructural development, but an Africa that can fund and execute infrastructural development by itself. We must towards an Africa that is not depenedent on the US, China, EU, IMF, World Bank. The Nigeria of our dreams is an Africa that is economically, financially, politically and diplomatically independent, self-sufficient and self-sustainable.\nOnly Africa can develop Africa!!!!!﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Michael Ogbuigwe"}

Was it because they didn't develop technology and was busy cutting each other's head off for centuries before that? Or was it because they were selling their own people to the west as slaves? I wonder? Yes they have been colonized but why? Perhaps they were a weak target that didn't focus on improving themselves? China was screwed pretty bad, they realized it, stood up and look at where they are now? Now they are basically a superpower. Africa was screwed even earlier than the Chinese was screwed, if they had chose to stand up and improve back then, they would have been a superpower a long time before China became one, but no, you choose to be weak, endless dictatorships, blaming the \"white devils\" but not doing anything about it, not that I'm saying what European countries did to you was just, but the FACT IS you did nothing about it, that's why you are poor and weak, and requires China to give you handouts.﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Kai Keeper"}

Something we never got from the West after centuries of colonizing us and then doing business with us after colonialism and slavery ended.\nWe had zero choice when the West landed foot in Africa. And centuries later when we did, we never got anything out of it cause they designed businesses in ways that profited them more than it profited us.\nInstead of building factories here, the West sold finished goods to us which put us in endless debts that we had to suck their dicks constantly as a sign of submission. Or you could call it NEOCOLONIALISM.\nBut today, China is changing all that. We are being sold goods that we can afford with ease and they are building lots of infrastructural projects across Africa.\nLet's also mention that they are not carrying out any form of military campaign for any reason nor trying to decide who is the 'good guy' that is fit to rule any country.\nIn 50 years time, where do you think the allegiance of Africa's 54 nations would be?\nSame goes for Asia which China is on top of the food chain.

If we cared about power we could have been far nastier than we have been, more like our ancestors were 150 years ago. We are the dominant military power on the planet for the last 70 years, and if we wanted to we could have ensured no culture rose up to challenge us. This is the normal pattern in history, and yet we never acted that way. We are not the same people as our ancestors.\n\nWe want wealthy countries around the world to trade with. We want strong allies. More important, we want people to not have to live under any one else's control so they can become who they want to be, do what they want and live their lives in control of their own destinies. \n\nIf we were so bent on keeping power, would we have all these Chinese students in our colleges learning engineering and other weaponizable skills? Do you think we would be anything but happy if India became wealthy and powerful? We would not, because India is not a threat to us. Not our power, but to us. The same cannot be said of the Chinese government.\n\nSay what you like, think what you like, but when China started using their military to hack us for economic purposes they declared economic war. When they pegged the Yuan lower than the dollar they declared economic war. When they militarize the S. China Sea and threaten their neighbors over some imaginary 9-line because that country (Vietnam) wanted to build an offshore oil well in their own waters, they are stealing and pushing things into a military conflict. Only a blind idiot could see it any other way. \n\nChina abandoned their peaceful rise, cooperation with their trade partners and decided on confrontation and to upset the status quo. The same status quo that allowed them to rise and become a super power, a status quo that is lifting up some of the poorest countries in the world. Why? Pure dominance, just as bad as our ancestors even if they do not have the reach to match their appetite yet.\n\nTo fix this is simple. Stop stealing from other countries. Demilitarize the S. China Sea so Vietnam can build a desperately needed oil well and lift their citizens up. Stop looking at the US as a target to be knocked off and instead as a trade partner that has done more than any other country to help China bring their people out of poverty than any other. Use us as an example of how to and how not to do things and as a benchmark of progress to be made without cutting our throats. The EU doesn't act like this. England and us are not enemies. Vietnam and the US are coming back together even after a recent war. We want friends, not peasants who do what they are told.\n\nFixing this is made harder because China has an authoritarian government, and authoritarian governments traditionally cannot help themselves than to seek power for powers sake. If that is all that there is to China's government and our relationship, conflict is inevitable.﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "James Stepp"}
