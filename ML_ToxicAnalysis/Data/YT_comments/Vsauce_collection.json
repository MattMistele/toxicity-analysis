One would assume if they actually met, it'd cause something like the big bang. Which would also imply that the big bang is actually the merging of two separate universes.Ôªø", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "99%Gaming"}

Sending that light through a cable or through the insterstellar medium, does not change anything about the laws it follows. \n\n\nEven if you turn around at the speed of light, the last light that was sent before you turned, will still travel in its previous direction at the speed of light. The light after you finished turning, will travel in the opposite direction at the speed of light and every direction you passed in turning around, will get the exact amount of light that will be emitted in the exact time you spend looking into that direction, while turning around. The change of direction does not affect the speed the light itself travels. So information still travels at the speed of light.Ôªø", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "liquidminds"}

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.Ôªø", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Gaster Of Ink"}

He reasoned like this: you can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that  there is no gap between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir instantaneously. Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary particles -- kingons, or          possibly queons -- that do this job, but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages,      involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the signal, were never fully expanded because, at that point, the bar closed.‚Äù\r\n\r\n‚Äï Terry Pratchett, MortÔªø", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Byorski"}

I've heard a slightly different version, which I actually like better: \"The farther I extend the radius of my knowledge, the more my circumference borders on ignorance.\"  The effect you mentioned (Dunning-Kruger?) is REAL!!!  Boy, oh boy, is it real.  Ignorant people often hold the most untenable opinions, and they often hold them most tenaciously.  However, as Frank Herbert pointed out, experts can run into their own problems; namely that of not believing there's much they DON'T know about their field(s).  It often takes some young scientist to come along and say, \"You old guys have it all wrong!\"  It's quite shocking when that turns out to be true!  Such was the case a hundred years ago, when many scientists were sure there wasn't anything left to learn about physics.  Oops.  And that meteorologist who dared to tell all the geologists that the Earth's surface moves around?  He was roundly lampooned, and died without seeing his finding vindicated.  Not to mention poor Boltzmann.  \"Being an expert locks you up tight,\" one of Herbert's characters said, and boy, oh boy was she right.

The heat returning would rush across the earth following the shadow as it moves off. Even though the change in temperature would be minute as it would happen so quickly, there must be some difference just the same. So the heat change moving across the face of the earth could in theory move at the speed of light or faster, dust and other small objects could be displaced obviously they wouldn't move very fast but the heat trail itself should be able to.\n  Now we just need an object larger than the sun to pass very quickly across it to prove the theory.

Since you can control the wavelength emitted from each generator you would be able to create varying patterns of light and dark traveling along the Y axis. Your photocell on the Y axis could then output predetermined 1's and 0's faster than the speed of light. \n\nI know there has to be a scientific explanation for why this wouldn't work, but I always feel inspired after watching Vsauce and had to share haha.\nPlease, someone explain my ignorance to me!Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "David Gatten"}

The ability is remote viewing. Remote viewing is not some crazy thing which is made up or fantasy because if it were then the Military's of the world would not waste any time or money in such a thing that was fake or false.\n\nAn example of faster than light speed is this. When certain remote viewers viewed the dark side of the moon to see why there were lights & radio emissions coming from there as the early astronauts experienced as they orbited the moon, the remote viewers viewed human's & visitors working together. If you can believe this then you might say big deal. The fact remains which no one really makes any acknowledgement of is that light takes around 8 seconds to travel from the Earth to the moon & vice versa. So the viewers perceptions if they were travelling at the speed of light then anything that they could understand & witness would be 16 seconds into the the past. The problem was that everything these remote viewer see & witness is in real time even if they are viewing something of the past or future it's in real time of that time. So if they are witnessing something going on right now then they are breaking the speed of light with their perceptions the same goes for if their perceptions take a look at something in the past or future.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Solar Function"}

Your statement that anything can move faster than light is not only poorly explained but more so your point of the scissors, where they move via electro-mechanic interaction, but that would mean that the space between the particles would change over a large distance, (as you implied) over a large enough distance this would cause your \"scissors\" would either break and assuming they were made to be indestructible would still bend (IE the blade would not accelerate equally as fast as the point the motion started) the reason this never happened is due to your ignorance of how the universe interacts with matter, there can be things that move faster but it is no form of matter, or rather the express lack of it, either from a black hole, or a gravitational force strong enough to pull in light, your comment that information cannot travel faster than light, is not so much a rule as it is a guide line of the universe and it's metaphorical check book, maintaining balance. Take background radiation for example, it doesn't so much as travel as it is ever present much like your botched theory of darkness and it's so called speed, how you thought you couldn't measure the speed of something that doesn't exist  is somewhat idiotic.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Psycho GameZ"}

The people throwing out the information may very well know what they are saying is BS, but their market research has made it apparent they will get the most hits from people by presenting certain types of information in certain ways.  Being aware of this allows us to be more cognizant of what we are being told and take a more realistic stance toward how we accept information, and throw doubt on the confidence of the people making their claims, and the confidence of the people so willing to parrot them.Ôªø", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Craig Yack"}

The light travels at a speed less than the distance to the moon-¬†that would show a delay¬†action because the medium, for observation is light. also the area of the visible moon is only a few thousand miles, the distance from one side of the moon to the other is very small; so even if the moon was closer to the Earth as so there was no delayed action caused by the excess distance. Your shadow wouldn't be faster, as the speed of I86,000 miles per second could go around the moon around 20 times per second.

I bet that if he measured each one of them, the sum of them all would be greater than the size of what he was sure he ignored.\n\nAbout the same point: as for his account on ignorance, he looks not less self indulgent (or self confident/presumptuous) than on the previous account, for it seems he believed he knew a lot about it, like the growing and infinite circumference on its boundaries, which is not little thing, we must agree on this. What he proposed tends to be more like a prospected knowledge than like crude ignorance (which, by the way, if definable, would be as whatever we ignore that we ignore).\n\nBack to the informativeness of shadows, it is like induced ignorance (metaphorically and not), although we're still able to deduce what should be there and even its amount. Setting up an experiment surely tastes like this - inducing shadows - and the problem with it starts when the shadows keep there after it is finished (Popper's devil would laugh at this).\n\nIn concluding these stray thoughts, all this made me wonder whether the obscurities concerning what we think we know, further than coinciding with it, aren't indeed caused by some undetected aspect of our endeavor to know.Ôªø", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Wal Reis"}

The physical limit of velocity being that of light isn't because the universe just thought there should be a speed limit that everyone obeyed, it is that because once you start getting close to the speed of light the energy forces required to keep accelerating you increase exponentially till at the point of light speed, they become effectively infinite. Or rather you can never get to that point because each tiny progression closer requires a disproportionately greater amount of energy. Then when you collide with anything, that energy is released and you'd come apart at a subatomic level.

{"cid": "UgxF52T1mwEKaX5dQlJ4AaABAg", "text": "Light and darkness travel at the same speed relatively. Darkness is dark and light is light. They are both relative. Shadows are limited to the speed of light they are obstructing. but when shadows move and the light comes back then it moves again at the speed of light relative to the distance. White light will spread from a light source but a specific light wave from a laze is so focused that the shadow from your hand in frond of a laser would be the same size from the earth to the moon.\n\nLight travels at about 186 thousand miles per second and the moon is how far from the earth? It still takes the same time if you had a concentrated light source on the sun to travel to the earth as all wavelengths of light or white light to travel the same distance from the sun to the earth which is appx. 9 minutes. If the sun exploded right now at this precise moment we would not even know until 9 minutes later.\n\nShadows diffuse according to white light and that is because of other light waves causing the fuzzyness between your fingers. From the earth to the more there may be no more shadows from an object passing in front of a light source. Even during a total Solar Eclipse there are edges of the shadow that are dimmed instead of snuffed totally out. During the last Solar Eclipse we had about 60 percent darkness compared to people five hundred miles north that actually saw stars come out. During sunset is because of the atmosphere spreading white light and turning it orange or red. This was different it was white light but dimmed and the sky still stayed blue but a deep azure blue.\n\nSo with all that said the speed of Dark is Limited to the Speed of Light and both are relative to one another.\n\nActually thank you because what you posted is something that makes people wonder and think and that is the first rule of science. I think I will subscribe and give a thumbs up.Ôªø", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "weejams"}

Whenever he does it something bad ends up happening, like him literally disappearing from existence and becoming one with the speed force, the 9nly thing that travels faster than the speed of light in the comics, and where his power comes from. He has broken the timeline multiple times by traveling faster than the speed of light. Because he can travel back without going as fast but when he goes faster than the speed of light, well... You can count DC comics are planning on doing some reboots right after lol. \n\nBut they do explain it in the comics that all speedsters that use the speed force have a energy shield around them that prevents them from sting when traveling at those speeds. It's why when he touches people when he goes fast they dont brake their necks or their body just dismantles, the speed force wraps whoever is near him to protect them from the force he produces.Ôªø", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "GoRd0oO"}

Think of it like how the absence of light in a shadow can still tell YOU the information of whatever it represents.\n\nYou as an intelligent being know what the shadow of a bird looks like, even if the shadow itself has zero information.\nIts the pattern of the absence that creates the information, but the information is only created in the aware concious mind of the observer. And this is what makes self-awareness and intelligence so incredible.\nYou can actually CREATE information from that which inherently, by all laws of physics, has ZERO information within it.\nThus one can argue that our minds actually work \"faster than the speed of light\", since we can percieve and infer information based on the absence of something, not just the presence of something.Ôªø", "time": "8 months ago (edited)", "author": "Baleur"}

As a side note, black holes have proof in the pudding that they exist, as there is visible phenomena of black holes existing. I agree that if something moves it has energy, though all things creating energy that propagates out, not so much. Also matter creating energy isn't really a thing, its more converted. The atom bomb unfortunately kinda helps prove that point...\nAnother thing that might sway your view based on the way you perceive the world, is that black holes truly do exist. Maybe their name doesn't suit your sensibilities, but there is truth to their existence. There is documented proof they're real. There is a great video by Kurtge... Kurgez...Kuzge.... just a really hard name to remember but it explains them in better detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-P5IFTqB98\nOverall i do agree that theory dictates much of our reality, but (on a minor nitpick) many things have evidence, that as of now, is pretty strong in their favor and shifts them from more of a theory to a reality, such as gravity.Ôªø", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Random Nibba"}

Also I am still very sceptic about proving because evry proven thing needs to be proven and every proven needs a prof and so on -proves must be proven always -that is the hard part of philosophy and good science. (I think I made a mess here with the word prove ;)  Anyway proven things must be proven by other proves always if we need truth - Also as far as I know our machinery (microscopes and telescopes) for the moment give us only a very very very small picture of what is out there -inner and outer spaceÔªø", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Stephanos Koukoulomatis"}

I haven't seen much on his predictions but based on his view he would contest the tradition methods of medicine before anyone even know what a bacterium or virus was.

The thing here is that shadows are caused when an object blocks light from reaching a surface and the time it takes for the surface behind it should be the time it takes for the remaining light behind the object casting a shadow, to disappear. It‚Äôs just like how many of the stars in the sky are so far away that it may not even exist anymore. Stars can live for billions of years and it wouldn‚Äôt make sense if it takes 500 years for the light to reach earth and 300 years to disappear. Same thing goes for our sun. The light takes about 8 minutes to reach earth, which means that there will still be 8 minutes of light traveling towards us if it were to suddenly disappear. \nShadows casted at a distance appear larger because of the light expanding and the object blocks some of that light from continuing to expand. The speed of light shouldn‚Äôt change just because of expansion. \nDarkness is also just the absence of light, not an opposing force that takes over when light is weakened. It can not be created using energy and doesn‚Äôt have any waveform. You can‚Äôt create darkness, but you can create light or reduce it to increase darkness. You can‚Äôt make absolute black any darker, but you can continue to make white brighter, though you‚Äôd go blind after some point. \nTherefore, the speed of light and ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù are the same.

A thing does not necessarily have to be tangible, reachable, or anything of this sort (the list goes on with scent, visual effects, etc) to exist. We can debate this on a long shot, by bringing in different philosophers / ideas. Judging by \"cogito ergo sum\", we have to think in order to exist, although the mind isn't touchable, yet it interacts with our system / others (through talking). Though, we can also talk about what (i think, i'm not sure though) Hegel said (i'm not sure about who said it, not whether someone said the following quote or not): \"It is but does not exist\" (i only know the romanian version of it, and it feels a bit weird translating it mot-a-mot in english, but it kinda sends the idea). Well regarding this one, i, personally, agree with. It pretty much says that a thing mustn't exist in the real world, or rather the third dimensional one that we live in and we call as the real world, for it to truly exist.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "xFulger9 Yasuo"}

I mean I truth they already were intertwined, sciences was built on philosophy and some philosophical ideas are built off science but most people usually don‚Äôt see much meaning in philosophy saying it‚Äôs worthless and can‚Äôt be used for anything. This video clearly proves that idea wrong. If nothing else, philosophical/abstract ideas and concepts can at least help us conceptualize and explain things in a way that is easier to understand despite the fact the way of explaining may be more complicated than the message/concept (there‚Äôs a paradox for you).  It‚Äôs getting better now but honestly things like the arts (meaning painting, music, philosophy, writing, etc) don‚Äôt get anywhere near enough credit. It‚Äôs the creatives that invented the lightbulb (Edison) or enrich our lives with music or books. Everything we have today was once an idea inside someone‚Äôs head. This means society and the economy itself rises on the backs of creatives and inventors. \n\nFor a long time people thought the earth was flat. ‚ÄúThe earth is flat. That‚Äôs a fact.‚Äù Or so they thought. But honestly facts are just widely accepted theories. Yes they‚Äôre based on visual and concrete evidence but there is more than one way to skin a cat. By thing I mean there is more than one way to look at the same thing.  Different perspectives has greater potential to make new discoveries and thus new jobs and new fields of science among other things. For a long time astronomers though water was essential to life on other planets. Norway‚Äôs that‚Äôs not really the case. They say, ‚Äúas far as we know, all life needs water.‚Äù But they also acknowledge difference in atmosphere and evolution. They think about how maybe some life forms can breath hydrogen or nitrogen instead of oxygen. I mean plants breath carbon dioxide so why not. And some very rare and very vulnerable cave animals have adapted to breath sulfur concentrated air. Some sharks can live in underwater volcanos and crabs, shrimps, mussels, and many other animals can live near poisonous Bryne pools and underwater volcanic vents. And if nothing else the deep sea life in this he ocean can live and have adapted lack of sunlight, freezing temperatures, and extreme pressures. This just shows how adaptable life is from deserts to Forrest to subterranean underground to the ocean. So (assuming ET is possible) they may not look like humanoid beings with large eyes and heads and small noses. It truth they could look like anything. Sorry didn‚Äôt mean to get weird there but my point is we know so little about the world. In some ways we know less about the ocean than outer space. This I tip my hat to Phillipo Doe.

Just like the dollar effect effects both sound and light the running Kruger effect effects personal growth, knowledge, wisdom, and so much more. Basically being to arrogant makes you careless of yourself, surroundings, and abilities thus inhibiting general progress in return. From a philosophical stand pint it‚Äôs hard but much healthier and better to loose. When being in the loosing team you realize your own weakness, how much room there is to grow, and thus can find ways to fix those weaknesses and mistakes thus improving growth. Of course this isn‚Äôt easy and t can be somewhat painful loosing all the time but if you‚Äôre aware of this and don‚Äôt mind letting someone have the spotlight, growth and progress in general improves drastically. Of course there are some cons to the pros as with most things but it‚Äôs all about your values. This concept is the reason why olympians make it to the olympics and why successful people can build their business from scratch. Admittedly it takes a lot of will power to go against the world in this way and it can be tough when people don‚Äôt always understand but if you push through you‚Äôll see the light see the end of the tunnel. In other words, by purposely loosing all the time you stay humble and smart and thus progress rapidly.Ôªø", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Blackbird 123"}

We didnt bother with the other path because we thought that may be other peoples property then my other cousin came along and he went through the path we then found a giant open area with a beach along a river and it was a very cool place. We now go down there whenever im over.

Mine was 8 of spades.\n\nHeck it's even possible to draw the correct card 52 times of the 52 times you drew. Also 3:21 No they won't!

You said that the universe is 1*10^18 seconds old! But I did the math and the answer that I got was 4.3233912*10^17!! Of course you are not wrong! You've just corrected it to the nearer power of ten! Fine! But the difference is huge! I know this doesn't mean anything to you.....but just wanted to say! The play of probability was amazing, by the way! I think I have a hell load of questions and stuff to talk about! I want to know a proper way of communicating with you! How will that be possible without your response? Can you do that for me? I know you've got a lot going on....like the multiple number of channels and mind field and everything..... But I ain't some waste of time! I don't want you to believe this right away but you will,if you make our chat come true. I've been trying to reach you through Facebook..... But.....it's not a proper way! I don't even see a \"message\" icon! So it's up to you now!Ôªø", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Prabanjan ADSLM"}

But since in both instances they disappear the same exact way means the same visual limitation of our perception is just repeating itself through different instruments.\n\nIt means the camera only extends our vision only so far and the limitation of horizon will repeat itself. A latter or a better camera, both will expand your view of the horizon.\n\nHow do salt lakes exist on a globe? There should be a large part of the globe that has a flat dent on it.

{"cid": "UgyIORAf3IhXXAG3zkt4AaABAg", "text": "Communication takes place in forms other than the verbal form. When you put on the tin foil hat you are using a form of communication that is non-verbal to insinuate that people who consider the earth to be flat are silly or stupid. This is insulting and biased. When people use such techniques of communication it suggests that they need something more than simple fact or proof to convince people of their own viewpoint. It is thus also a sign that you do not have a solid enough argument to convince your audience.\n\nThe experiment executed by Eratosthenes was  done from two, relative to the size of the earth, close-by locations. From the curvature between these locations, which assumes parallel rays of light which assumes the sun is very very far away (oh, the assumptions), he then elaborates this curvature and assumes that it applies to the entire earth. Seriously? So if I take a linear approximation of a mathematical function, then that linear approximation is applicable (or accurate) for the entire function? No, it is absolutely not! The same logic applies in these two examples. Just because something is locally true does not mean it is true overall. The curvature between two selected close-by points is not the same curvature, with acceptable tolerance, between every set of two points on the earth.\n\nYou make a claim that the arguments of flat-earthers are ad  hoc. I can say the exact same thing about the supposed facts of the Apollo mission and other space related information. If you put it all together it is very inconsistent and thus ad hoc. For example, the Van Allen Radiation Belt would have penetrated the Apollo spacecraft as well as its crew with particles, at densities and speeds, fast enough to kill them (like being shot with thousands of tiny bullets everywhere). The major problem in that memo is that the Van Allen Belt was only discovered after the Apollo mission supposedly took place. In contrast to your claim, there are a lot of consistent claims that flat-earthers make, so your argument is mute (actually it was merely a statement and not an argument, because an argument requires supporting proof).\n\nLastly you end the video by basically saying that the answers we have for things are either true or not. This is a real cop out perspective. Imagine buying a car and the wheels either fit or they don't, the frame is aligned, or not. The screws holding the wheels are either strong enough or not. You cannot have it both ways. You need definite answers here, otherwise people could die. This is where accuracy comes into play. We may not have exact answers, but we usually have very accurate answers within acceptable tolerances which keep us safe or guide us in the right direction.\n\nAnyway, besides all my criticism I really enjoy your videos. The reason for my criticism here is because I have a strong belief in proper, unbiased, logical arguments.Ôªø", "time": "1 week ago (edited)", "author": "Gustav Streicher"}

Arguing how gravity would turn a flat world into a sphere, when flat earthers do not believe in gravity. This video also states Earth rises which accounts for gravity which is also bogus, and yes... Ships do not disappear. Greeks needed a camera with a focus lense, and some how even bill Nye sticks to this point. I just want to watch a real proposition on why the flat Earth can not be, and all I see is bogus videos that keep smearing the flat Earth by talking about things any one could disown and say, yeah the Earth is not flat. Talk about why we are able to see too far, in which even the news claims as mirage, while we all know mirages don't happen every time you zoom a camera, and if it did, it will most likely be an upside down image. \n\nThe misinformation arriving from this video only solidifies in my thoughts, that the possibility of the world being flat is even more plausable than I thought.

You are being ignorant but besides that main problem here though is that you are so extremely deceived that you haven't found any of the real evidence and proof of the earth being flat and have only seen videos from mainstream media or by other decieved people and been programmed with legit propaganda.. I thought this shit was crazy too but I thought to myself if so many people are believing in it then there must be some grain of truth so I decided to research it with an open mind and what I found was astonishing. I found real proof the ice wall: https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-strong-evidence-about-the-ice-wall (click more on the first response). And I also found an Admiral by the name of Richard E. Byrd\r who led an expedition called Operation Highjump in Antartica, and in an interview he talks about finding unexplored land around the size of America down there. A few days later I came across a 1000 year old flat earth map that has a land mass past the south pole that fits that size he said, and also is pointed to by the operations journey.. Look into the \"Norb\" theory if you want the science behind a flat planet. At this point your probably wondering why would something of this scale be hidden? The answer is to hide the existence of heaven and hell. Only a flat earth supports them. There is blatant evidence of the freemasons and the roman catholic church worshipping satan and why would they do that if God isnt real? And if God and Jesus are real then the earth is flat like the Book Of Enoch says.

For example, if a ship were leaving the harbor, it seems to be sinking, but it isn't. The sea is curving, and that's why the ship seems to be sinking.

Walking around on the planet's surface, it looks and feels flat, so they deem all evidence to the contrary, such as satellite photos of Earth as a sphere, to be fabrications of a \"round Earth conspiracy\" orchestrated by NASA and other government agencies.\n\nThe belief that the Earth is flat has been described as the ultimate conspiracy theory. According to the Flat Earth Society's leadership, its ranks have grown by 200 people (mostly Americans and Britons) per year since 2009. Judging by the exhaustive effort flat-earthers have invested in fleshing out the theory on their website, as well as the staunch defenses of their views they offer in media interviews and on Twitter, it would seem that these people genuinely believe the Earth is flat.Ôªø", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "BlackMoon X"}

Despite the fact that gravity would pull things toward the body's center and further make it back to a ball, what if the gravity was never real, but instead it was just the platform we are living on moving \"upward\", as we feel it? Now, you might say if that were the case, when you jump, the floor would catch up to you before you even land yourself, but remember that when you are jumping on a platform that is moving upward, the height of your jump increases as well, just like jumping on a trampoline. Well, if we were constantly moving away from our original place, wouldn't other planets just seem farther and farther by time? No. Because there is an invisible string under human eyes that is pulling the solar system together. Well why would the Earth be flat if all of the other planets were round?... Or since when were they? The truth is that they are just, as well, as flat as the Earth, but facing us, creating and illusion that they are round.\n\n\n\nOk that was the stupidest comment I've ever spent time on don't hateÔªø", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Bokocop"}

I shut off all of the lights in my room, walked into my closet, and began pulling back on the trigger. Suddenly I heard a very deep and loud voice that filled the room. The voice said, \"my son, if you do this, you shall surely go to hell\". I opened my eyes because I had no idea who was talking to me. In that moment I realized that all of the lights were turned on in my room and the closet door was all the way opened. I looked behind me at the dresser/drawer and saw a picture of Jesus Christ on it. I broke down in tears and dropped the gun, falling to the floor. When I woke up the next day, I felt as if a weight was lifted off of me, a weight that I did not know was affecting me. I was 21 back then. I'm 34 now and for the last decade I have been trying to figure out who spoke to me. I eventually stopped doubting and realized that The God who designed us and gave us breath, spoke to me on that evening. It is when I stopped the disbelief that I could hear and feel Him. If you stop doubting Him, even for just a day, you'll get your own proof of Him. As a matter of fact, He is waiting for you. Thank you for listening today. All the best to you and yours and blessings too, in Christ's name. Before finding Christ, I was a Satanist for about 4 years.Ôªø", "time": "2 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "Erik Sentinel"}

According to everyone else the 'ice wall' is of course called Antarctica, covering the southern pole, and is actually only a little more than 2,000 miles across, depending on where you chose to make your crossing. The only way that this 'shortcut' from one side of earths 'ice wall', to the opposite side of earths 'ice wall' could be explained would be that it is nothing short of a miracle. Travel the distance of 22,500 miles in only a bit more than 2,000 miles. \n\nOkay. If that is not good enough then simply check the postulated circumference of the 'flat earth' and compare it to the circumference of Antarctica, and then explain why they are NOT exactly the same?Ôªø", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "J F"}

Truth is a discovery. If you believe the earth is a sphere then you are pre-resolved and thus inhibited from considering anything else unbiased. Ego attachment may ruin your intelligence and imagination\nFor example; did they go to the moon? unless you went to the moon you would have to believe NASA. \nDo nuclear weapons exist? What evidence do you have that they do? \nAre vaccines harmful to ones health? What negative consequences have vaccines had on your well-being? Do you know? Then the precautionary care makes sense\nThe natural law principle of cause and effect is such that the effect, mild or severe, does not necessarily occur immediately in time after the cause. The last ten years of my neighbours life was hell, lung disease from those many chemicals in the many cigarettes he was smoking. Chemicals cause cancer.\nSubstituting belief for truth is not thinking. If there is an individual that can demonstrate how others can discover the shape of the earth then there can not be any further discussion. \nThere are only two ways to be fooled, to believe what is not true and to refuse to accept what is true.Ôªø", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "01ddave"}

Please let me ask a few questions about that.\nThe shadow is the round earth (sphere or disk doesn't matter) and the light comes from the sun.\nSo if the earth is a disc and the lunar eclipse is visible, that would mean that the moon is \"above\" the disc, otherwise we couldn't see it. But wouldn't that mean, that the sun at that point, had to be below the earth disc? I have not found anything about that yet.\nI also found that the North Star disappears when you travel south, because of the so called vanishing point. Okay, I can see that could make sense. But how is it possible you can always see the south cross no matter where on the southern hemisphere you are?\nEven easier, how does the antarctic summer work?\nHow big exactly is the earth? I was told, that the equator is slightly less than 40.000 km. So that would mean to travel in an inner circle of the antarctica you would have to cover a distance of at least 70.000 km.\nBut probably this is wrong to, can you give me a plausible flat earth map with an accurate scale? Because I have found multiple different maps within the flat earth society. Which is a bit strange to me.\nIt also messes with several expreditions across the antarctica, but i guess those are all lies as well.\n\nBut the most worrying things to me are the flat earth maps, the lunar eclipse being possible without the sun setting below the earth disc and the antarctic summer, please give me an explanation for those.Ôªø", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "RairyuOrigin"}

It is an appeal to consequences fallacy, what is true doesn't depend on what's going to happen, even if humans go on a killing streak because they aren't in the center of the universe, doesn't make it false. And he is dead wrong. Just because, here comes his religious shit, we aren't supervised by a God, people won't lose value of life and won't act differently. Only people who believed in God lose anything, but that's because they were taught in the first place. Making someone addicted to cigarets for example, then taking it away causing side effects doesn't make cigaret good.  And people still answer for what they did, by us.

Nothing but Gravity could be the cause.\nThe Earth is CONSTANTLY pulling the Moon towards it. So does the planets, but some planets are actually pulling more on it. But, of course, the Earth is nothing for the Sun's gravitional pull in that case. Moon only stays in orbit around the Earth because it's so close. And please learn about orbits, it's caused by the gravitional pull of an object (planet or star in most cases) and the motion of the other object. And gravity is exactly the reason Helium balloons rise up. A helium balloon is less dense than the air around it, so it will pull stronger on the surrounding air, but that air displaces the balloon, causing it to rise. Density doesn't explain it because it doesn't havr a direction, density plays a role in why things fall down, to be more exact what counter force there is against gravity, but doesn't give the direction of down. Air is less dense for example all around us, and in a helium balloon's case, again, the air is more dense all around it, so it would just press on it 360¬∞ until it pops. Gravity, or the gravitional force toward the center of mass, in this case the Earth causes the downward force. Neat and simple.\nIt's real because it looks real and couldn't have been faked at the time. We are talking about 1972 here, and why would it be faked? The moon landing has been proven to be impossible to fake, so we have no reason to think they went there but faked photos of it for some odd reasons. The photo is taken from the Moon my dude lol. And that explonation doesn't work, in that case the slightest movement of the camera would offset the viewing angle of the Window, causing the image to shift. And in an apollo mission the camera moved in front of a window. Simple doesn't work. \nI don't believe it because they aren't proofs but conspiracytard ignorant idiots talking out of their ass like they know what they are talking aboutÔªø", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "√Åkos K√∂rmendi"}

His friends 8 and 9 pushed him to ask her out to prom, and she said yes. They fell in love and got married, 6 got a job as an electrician and 7 played as the house wife. They had 2 beautiful twin girls named 4 and 5, they liked to play hide and seek in the back yard a lot together. But 6 was getting stressed out because he couldnt pay his bills which caused him to drink, he started to get distant from his own family. 6 started taking it out on his wife and kids by beating them. One day 6 took it too far and killed 7 right in from of 4 and 5, and then called the police, and hung himself in front of his kids.4 and 5 for taken to an orphanage after that, they couldnt get the image out of their head, of their daddy beating mommy and hanging himself afterwards without a thought of his own kids. A lot of the kids in the orphanage didnt like 4 and 5, they made fun of them for having weird names, all that they had was each other. One of the top dog orphanes, 17, started pushing around 4, 5 tried to step in and protect her twin sister, but he was too strong and threw her out of the way. 17 began to tear off 4's pants as she cried and flayed, and then began to unbutton his own pants. A huge member came out of his trousers, in the shape of a 7, and stuck it inside 4's 0. 5 flailed her arms on 17's back crying for him to stop, but he threw his arm towards 5, causing a deep red gash on her forehead, she was knocked out. 17 began to take his hands and cover them over 4's mouth and nose, leaving her unable to breathe, and then faded to a darkness. 17 was given a life sentence in a high facility prison for the murder of 2 girls.Ôªø", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "1k Subs With No Videos"}

{"cid": "UgwCmln_n_nTbdoEOfZ4AaABAg", "text": "It's weird. Most people would find the solution to life not going by fast to be to live longer. But the truth is that people who died in their 50s thought life went by too fast, and it was too short. And so did people who died in their 70s, and people who died in their 90s. But the person who died in their 90s lived almost twice as long as the guy who died in his 50s. It feels like I could live to 200, and by the end I'd still wish I had more time. The only way I can imagine life not going fast is to restart, go back to when a year was your whole life. If you woke up one day with amnesia, and don't remember any of your past life, one day must seem like your whole life again. Life's not going by too fast, but at the same time, it's now incredibly short. If you died that same day, you'd have really only lived one day, even though you're much older. But at least it felt like a long day?Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "One Piece Fandub"}

{"cid": "Ugw09cvdl8Pra37r77R4AaABAg", "text": "Could you let me know if these numbers are a coincidence or something more?¬† Read this if you want to know things that no one else in Earth knows.  I have 100 percent proof Manson is the antichrist and that God also sent Superman here 11 years later and I promise this is not a joke. This is the one time that the crazy person saying the crazy things is actually telling the truth. In revelation 1:4 there are 7 letters to 7 churches. Philadelphia is one of them, the original capital and start of the United States. This year Philly won their first super bowl in 2018. Philadelphia to Canton Ohio is exactly 333 miles as the crow flies, this where Marilyn Manson the antichrist was born in 1969. This is also where the football Hall of Fame is. Canton Ohio to Chicago is exactly 333 miles as the crow flies. Chicago is where Anton Lavey published the satanic Bible in the same year Marilyn Manson was born 1969. That adds up to 666, this is the true root of the mark of the beast. It is finally solved so we are close to the end. The reason I figured out to break the mark of the beast in half is because that number has never left me alone. I even noticed 333 was even engraved on the ignition key of the last Motorcycle after I bought it. Manson and Anton Lavey became friends and they first met each other at Anton's Laveys house which happened to be in San Francisco. God sent a villain but God also sent Superman 11 years later. Robert Stroud the birdman of Alcatraz is one of God's special Angels. After he died he was buried cross country in Metropolis Illinois, the only city that is named after superman‚Äôs hometown. Jerry Siegel who created Superman in 1933 died 33 years later on the birdman‚Äôs birthday, January 28 1996. Metropolis Illinois to Fort Wayne Indiana is exactly 333 where I wrote the book American Wonderland, a book that once and for all proves God and Jesus exists. This is my soul purpose on Earth is to prove God and Jesus are 100 percent real before the end and Jesus comes back. If you add up all 3,¬†333 mile lines it equals 999. Their is only one picture in existence that shows both Anton Lavey and Marilyn Manson together and above them you can clearly see the number 999. ¬†There was an incident the day after Carmelo Anthony of the Orangemen beat the Kansas Jayhawks in 2003 to win their first NCAA title. This day I almost drowned where the St. Mary's meets the St. Joseph River to form the Miami River in Fort Wayne Indiana. This is the day I walked the yellow brick road in real life and ended up meeting OZ at St. Joseph hospital. I‚Äôm still not kidding. Ever since then I have had one biblical happening after another. I haven't aged since 2003 as well.¬† If #23 Wayne Anthony would have not been injured for the Kansas Jayhawks, Kansas most likely would have won that Championship Game.¬† Wayne Anthony later won a title in the NBA with the Miami heat. Fort Wayne was founded by Anthony Wayne. Johhny Depp was one of God's special Angels until he became best friends with Marilyn Manson, they even have matching tattoos. If you ever watch the old 1962 movie \"the birdman of Alcatraz\" the first bird Robert saves is a Sparrow he names Jack. In pirates of the Caribbean, john plays Captain Jack Sparrow. The reason I know so many things is because of all the things God has put me through, which led me to 15 years of research.¬† God revelation story starts at Philly where they filmed Rocky to Alcatraz the rock, which both stands for Peter the Rock, Jesus's best friend. I was born January 27, 1980 and the birdman of Alcatraz was born on January 28, 1890. The Golden gate bridge started construction on Marilyn Manson birthday January 5th 1933. This is where the end will start, he's either going jump off or get baptized in the water underneath the bridge, his choice. Either way the wicked witch is getting wet. To Get to Alcatraz you have to take a ferry at Pier # 33. Notice how many times the number 33 keeps popping up. It‚Äôs a code God keeps putting in front of us to remind us of Jesus. On January 5th 1982 there was a landslide in San Francisco that killed 33 people in which they also had to shut down the Golden Gate Bridge.¬† That landslide occurred exactly 49 years to the day after the start of construction on Golden Gate Bridge and is also the same day Marilyn Manson turned 13. There is a reason Marilyn Manson turned 49 this year, and there is a reason he was born in Canton Ohio, the football hall of fame and there is a reason Philadelphia won this year.¬† This is the year that the end begins. I don‚Äôt know how many coincidences I have to point out until people realize it‚Äôs impossible to have that many coincidences.¬† That this is all connected to Gods much bigger plan.¬† Everything that happened now, and in the past was planned out by God billions of years ago so that the one day the things God did would be connected so people no longer have to guess if God is real, they will know. I didn't just randomly pick Manson, a voice guided me to Marilyn Manson autobiography \"the long hard road out of hell back in 2001‚Äù. I‚Äôm not even scratching the surface of what I know that nobody here on earth knows.¬† Sincerely Nickolas GiantÔªø", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Nick Giant"}

{"cid": "UgwUGOxCH8UocHzlqcp4AaABAg", "text": "Hey, Vsauce.\nI think your point about people caring less about 5$ saved from 2000$ purchase than from 5$ saved from 10$ purchase is not that convincing/related. It actually has a good strategical foundation. Unless you belong to Rothschild family, you won't be conducting 2000$ purchases that often at all. May be once per year, may be even rarely. While you'll be conducting 10$ purchases, like, every day, often several times per day. So, it becomes a very important policy to enforce extra caution to 10$ purchases, as cumulative benefit from saving several dollars from each of it will be times and times more than from a single annual 2000$ purchase. And when you once in a while will decide to spend 2000.. whatever, you can afford to lose 5$ here, it's not that much, it's just loss of 5$/year - especially when to save them you need to put some additional effort.\n\nTry to conduct the same research among offsprings of  really rich families, and you may find they demonstrate equal (and meager) consideration both for saves from 10$ and 2000$ purchases.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Sovey Reemo"}
