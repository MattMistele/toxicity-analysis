C: "comes across as a hard worker rather than the really outstanding potential scholar" Unfortunately for my YT karma, I have to side with Harvard for this point alone. Just so people know, according to the Harvard Admission Statistics webpage, Asian Americans consist of 22.9% of the student body. This is the second highest ethnicity admitted at Harvard. If Harvard is deliberately turning Asian students away then why is almost one in four students Asian?
With that said, all my schools were Asian dominated so these things the Harvard admissions interviewers are saying aren't lies. If Harvard wants a particular type of student and you don't fit that criteria too bad. You may get excellent grades, but HARVARD WANTS MORE THAN THAT. They want more than people who just grind away for the A, because every top notch school is like that. Harvard wants people that stand out from society.
The vast majority of students I've met unfortunately fit many of the stereotypes Harvard very clearly doesn't want in its schools, Asian or not. Elitism sure is getting its fair share of the media spotlight lately; but its also what has set Harvard apart from other schools.
Harvard fucked up by keeping its admissions procedure secret, but for good reason. you can't ignore the statistics and they haven't. they know its fucked up thus the quiet nature of the admissions procedure. I am can guarantee that the same applications would be turned away if they were reviewed anonymously.?                              Toxic  80.82%
C: Abstract: In this paper, we report on a new cure for cancer.
Introduction: Cancer is known to be an incurable disease [1].  However, there are studies that disproves this belief [2-3].
Conclusion: We have done tests based on these studies and have shown that cancer is curable.  However, the current established medical system finds that curing cancer for the human population too rapidly would lead to a loss of consumers and therefore a steady stream of revenue, and have thus blocked our efforts at further developing this cure.  Aliens [4] and the Illuminati [5] are also real.

C: Yes Tigerstripes,

These assholes found an opportunity to spew their racist garbage about Black people on a post like this. Notice they have not said a word about the rich white kids with low grades who get in because their rich Daddy donated a building or something.

These fucks think Harvard accepts any Black Jim and Jack when 1.) Black people make up such a small percentage of Harvard that it does not affect the enrollment rates of other demographics, and 2.) They are dismissing the hard work those Black people utilized to get into Harvard.

I now see why these assholes aren't getting into Harvard, the admission officers can smell their entitlement, tone deafness and racist tendencies a mile away.?                                                             Toxic  93.22%
