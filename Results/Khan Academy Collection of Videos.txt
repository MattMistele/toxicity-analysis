## Note: I scraped a few dozen of Khan Academy's videos, but only ended up with a few hundered comments to analyze rather than the ~10,000 I have been for other channels. Because it found no toxic comments for any of the videos, I've decided to include all of the comments for reference.

I'm a young YouTuber, who's inspired by what Sal Khan has done. Like many of my friends, his videos are quite helpful in understanding some subjects that can be difficult to grasp. I have made a few videos myself, and hopefully they too can teach you something! I would really appreciate any comments or advice on how to improve my content!

C: There's a much easier way to do this. Since the constants A&B have to be true for all values of x. And since the denominators are the same on both sides, just look at the numerators and set them as an equation.

X - 5= a(x -1) + b(2x-3)

First set x = 1, turning x -1 into 0, so the equation becomes

1-5=b(2*1-3)
Simplifying b equals 4. You can do the same thing, by picking x equals 3/2, cancelling out the b part of the equation, and solving for a?         Not Toxic  0.16%
